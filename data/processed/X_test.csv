353,excellent reception amazing app that lets you keep in touch with family and friends without the worry of expensive mobile bills.
384,why can't google get it for a company being the most used internet search engine you would think google would be smart enough to conjure a team up to fix these problems they have. i also agree with a few others who thinks google messages and hangouts should combine somehow to make it work how the iphones imessage works

634,"nice update really nice update this update is awesome, but the quick search is really usless, but its okay. keep up the good works (^_^)"

841,all nepali must use
576,"fail to launch i can sign i online via a pc but the app gets me nowhere. it downloaded fine but now that it is on my phone i am in a never ending sign in loop where i get their blurb, press the button to login, enter u/n & pw but then it takes me right back to the app's burn. frustrating to say the least after i was so looking forward to making use of this app after having downloading it on chrome."

659,"it's all awesome. can you devs please add more emojis when you have time :) no hurry, keep up the good work &lt;3"

47,"came here to rate this app to give 5 stars for good optimization for android this is one of the only apps that i open and close and it actually clears fully from ram and does not use up cpu power, unlike facebook and its messenger using up ram and cpu."
627,outstanding this app is not only fabulous on android platform but also popular. this is the first app which can be useful for all people.

797,"inferior to desktop browser i love firefox on my desktop but the android version is terrible. 1) it crashes constantly, 2) scrolling is very jerky, 3) on screen rotation the window doesn't resize, 4) there is no word wrap when answering certain forums, 5) downloaded images are not available for use in forums or whatsapp without rebooting phone, 6) pages are very slow to load. both the pre-installed samsung browser and chrome are heads and shoulders above firefox. pity."
453,"very nice app best feature is all friends get in touch with it.. runs well during roaming and with low signal.. i hope to see some improvement as in group chatting if we have tag feature or topic hashtag feature within the group, so that we can refer to a particular topic in discussion , just like in twitter etc.. but within the group not public ..would be great."
492,"excellent this app is great, keep up the good work guys !"

591,very solid my one real complaint is no way to make anchor tags within a note so i can make a table of contents. otherwise great application.
602,"the most useful app in the marketplace if used properly . . . if you've ever thought how nice it would be to get rid of all the paper and clutter in your life and yet still have it available anytime/all the time using powerful searches, then evernote is for you. take a picture of anything and store it; scan paper using your smart phone or scanner and store it all in a note; forward emails directly into evernote; drag and drop computer files, create a note using your finger in handwriting or text mode, clip pages or parts of web pages, use voice . . ."

813,installed and immediately deleted this crap i have used firefox on my desktop for longer then i can remember and i will continue to only use it on my desktop. your only options for a homepage are the crap they want you to see or a blank page with nothing on it and you can't go to a bookmarked website unless you want to go back to their crappy homepage just to see your bookmark list.  and did i mention it's crap?
175,"it's alrightđ¤ i don't get to go on the cross wire i've got to 200 000 why why why.,đ˘đđđđâ â â đđľđşđăđđi forgot to tell u no sound on this game ........i hate it"

62,following back it doesn't let me follow people that have followed me back.. and also the amount of people following and followers is also incorrect.... overall it is a live appp
885,too many ads far more adverts than any other game i've played. i know it's free and they need the ads to make a profit but there needs to be a balance.
136,the scoring system on facebook gains more points than mobile on jelly levels and i think that needs to be changed. e.g.  using a colour bomb with jellies on candies gives much more points on fb  than mobile. also there are no fish once  u finish jelly levels. please change the scoring system so it is the same for both platforms and that there is no bias against mobile.
235,this game đ.i donno y ppl give it 1 star try it out. n i think if two updates  come wit heros it must be a titan n a character  from naruto  madara uchihađ

631,"fast on slow phones this seems to be the fastest browser i've been able to find for slow phones. its works great on my ancient samsung, and nothing usually works great on this old phone lol"
601,"camera option is horrible you can't crop the image sideways... it has to be perfect square or rectangle.  camscanner or microsoft lens are  better options for document images. and it needs notebooks within notebooks. the camera flash always on, and when you do needs it, it takes very long time to turn itself off after taking the picture. the document camera likewise needs to detect the edge of the document. editing the images must be done within the interface without going through skitch."
61,"videos and notifications my videos haven't been working for a long time on this app. whenever i try to watch a video someone else has posted, its black and white and all glitchy. i sometimes have no way of fixing it. next, i haven't been getting notifications in the app. i get them on my status bar, but when i go on the app i don't get a little number by the bell."
258,absurdly large file for an android browser and after lollipop upgrade i no longer have the space available for updates. would gladly uninstall if i could. over 40 megs for an android browser??
472,love it but there should be switch off or sign out button having a sign out option helps you maintaining your personal space. you can keep a check on the constant addiction and usage of this service and it can help you in striking a balance between your personal and social life.
799,"refuses to clear history on exit and submitting reports does nothing since i have been reporting this for the last few months. for those of you complaining about crashes, that is probably because you do not have enough internal memory to run firefox properly."
246,don't use if you have a lot of organized bookmarks they recently changed bookmarks to go to the top of of your bookmarks every time you open a new tab. it used to remember what bookmark folder you were in until a recent update. i also don't like that the folders are now at the top of each bookmark list  i'll be using firefox now.
108,not able send requests to connect not able to send requests to connect even i uninstalled this app. older version was much much better.
327,"viber rating - lacking code on the android phone, the in call widget is over the top command for all settings alterations on the screen. it is not able to be moved and i can't find the setting to turn it off. might wanna fix it. also it seems not to want to ring on the android phone when you make a call."
219,"there's a draught in th11 supercell needs to fix the draught caused by this update. this game is no longer fun. there's no loot to upgrade or donate. let th11s hit lower level bases, dead bases are dead, we're not wiping them, just going for collectors. this is the only way"
431,"useful and well designed, however glitchy the app is really well designed. however, i've begun to notice that if you end a call while it was on mute or if the call loses reception because of wifi issues on either person's end, the app does not record how long the conversation lasted. in fact, it doesn't show that a call even took place."
375,"ui & customization dark theme and color options. reply directly from the notification panel. options to change contact photos to initials and hide the timestamps. please bring back the gesture that takes you back to the conversation list by swiping from the left edge. write a message area is too cluttered, make it simplistic with a + sign. replace visible phone number with the name of the contact in send sms to..."
100,"down to 1 star after backward redesign this app design was perfectly adequate as of fall 2015, then one of these useless all new! redesigns was perpetrated.  now the old controls that let me manage the notification sound (silent, vibrate, etc.) are nowhere to be found.  had to turn off notifications totally to keep my phone quiet. that is unforgivably incompetent.  i find the overall design more confusing than prior layout, as many other reviewers do.   boo!  from 4 stars to 1."
287,not letting me log in! i try to log into my account with my user id and it says it needs to be verified by sending a code to my phone but it never does. i even press resend mutiple times. can you please help me?
27,doesn't work 90% of the time. doesn't update my news feed says cannot connect to internet. the internet on my phone works just fine. i can uninstall and reinstall and it fixes the issue for a few hours then it starts saying cannot connect to internet.
714,"for the build 13.0.2036.98649  new colour scheme adds nothing to the expirience. but it's the automated smart language update, with no option to select the prefered language that'll be the main reason why i'll uninstall this app."
648,"!! ! problem ! !! thank u sir ,your   speed mode off    idea works ,now i can play video on u tube.but one more problem is occur, whenever i tried to open any webpage suddenly a black   color screen appears  find solution for it ."
564,"unable to work with google & yahoo id sso notice that it still can't work with google / yahoo sso which is a big feature missing.  it is a good initiative, but still some work to be done before the star...  still thanks for the effort."
181,great but... lags waay too much. i always end up wasting gems when i die because it was lagging. please fix :)
40,⭐⭐⭐ when will this app be created to automatically start at the top with new posts instead of having to scroll through days of old tweets to get to the top! the only social app that does that! such a headache!
244,this country not allowed? i would have given it 5 stars because my searches and browsing are spot on but it took me to back up account and when i put my backup e-mail in it said this country not allowed: im in america! wtf????
103,doesn't work challenge page fails to load. it's so secure even i can't get in.
412,causes android device to not register touch this app has been causing issues making it so we can't use the upper left menu of our devices. multiple people have reported this and it is caused by your app please fix this and i will rate 5 stars.
496,everyone loves slack. count me among them
762,i love this app it is better than tv and old radio
344,"wtf keeps going offline automatically ,my messages never comes through until i open da app"
128,"umm.... while this game has gotten kinda old, and i've basically replaced it with the soda saga game, i still like playing this but for some reason, for i don't know how many days now, every time i go to open this game it'll load a little and then crash closed. fix please!!!!!!!!"
99,"updated version is down not able to sent connection request, no contacts synchronization . please develop soon"
567,"very bad i use xperia x8 and i think this app sucks. it never logs in, no matter how many times i change the password it always says it's not the right one. it also is not categorizes as a safe app, since its certificate is different then its name, so the anti-virus has to be off for it to connect. futhermore, it has no way to be sync-ed to the google account that allows you acces on the internet version."
475,"every company should use slack i don't usually give 5 stars, but man, slack is great for group company communication, in the office, at home, and on the go. takes a bit of getting used to but is well worth it."
657,"almost, but not quite. this has so much potential, but i really would like a back function that works, i press back and wait, nothing happens. i press back again and it takes me to the homepage,  same for the back button on the tablet,  i'm using a 1st gen nexus 7."
58,dont download not enough trump memes too much netflix and chill (stop already please). if you are looking for dumb girls that tweet everything that goes through their heads then this app is for you. #blessup
425,this has made my life hell!! it really sucks my cell hanged most of the time when it was there needs to improve so much đ đ đ
573,"does exactly what it states, thank you!"
92,"good app but......... why do post come up in a random order on the home screen, i have 4 day old posts at the top and have to scroll down to find new posts which are buried between 1 day to 1 week old posts, it needs to have an option for what order you want the posts in."
857,"how to upgrade angry birds angry birds is really cool however if you were to upgrade it i would make more birds do different things, second make more challenges and be able to customise your own birds with armour and different powers then  when you know what maps you have to destroy you can choose what bird will be best to use"
350,viber s.a.r.l. this app helps me to stay in contact while also having video options and picture options. really nice app and pretty stable running. just a few video and audio issues as well as video and call drops which can be annoying. sometimes the app is unstable but is mostly attributed to network issues rather than the app itself. i recommend this app.
71,"really great! twitter is an amazing app which i use frequently each day. i do have problems with it though. [this is personal preference] whenever i refresh the page, it gives me a tweet with the subtext [twitter name] follows [twitter name] and it happens every time i refresh, so can you only do it once since it clogs my feed with it whenever i want to see new tweets? othe than that its fine."
229,sucks the new update especially the multiplayer game bonuses sucks... please return to before system... only this time im getting more loots but supercell stop it saying im playing too long without shield then u got my village under attack and loose many of my loots... ur crazy... đ
760,good app all is good but sometime its cannot see live but otherwise its great app
424,stop opening like a full app i used to be able to play music on youtube and answer messages. now it stops the video each time i click on a chat head. if i really wanted to close an app and go to another to answer a message i would use something else.
323,mark i found viber to be extremely efficient way to communicate with my loved one. i have skype as well but it's not as good as viber.
757,please add option to provide pdf versions to download in mobile/tabs.
133,booster should be internet independent why internet connection required to get daily spin? it should be  part of game itself. every time i have open net connection to get daily spin. unacceptable.
107,"the worst!! this newer version/update might look nice, but i stopped getting all push notifications. also, the app doesn't even work most of the time. nothing loads and it keeps telling me to try again. it worked fine before until the most recent update. same as other apps, it just gets worse and worse. don't fix it if it's not broke!!!"
788,shite. crashes constantly! test 1st does nothing a browser should. obviously as all basic function is gone no testing was executed prior to release.      i do not use youtube or any sites that require more than a browser that loads the page without freezing & *bonus!* crashing the operating system.
608,"new user, great app. have suggestions so far, i love working with the app on all devices (desktop, web, & android phone). it integrates very well with other related apps! however, i would give 5 stars if developers could do 2 things: 1) allow check boxes/bullet items to be easily re-ordered [drag/drop] it's kind of a big deal for me and 2) allow duplication of notes. if these functions already exist, then hopefully someone will share how to do it, or i'll figure it out soon enough. and then i'll gladly rate 5 stars. great job guys!"
371,meh... hope it supports dual sim when used as default sms manager. and hangouts running very slow when opening a conversation
789,"the authority firefox is firefox, after wandering here and there you are gonna come back to this standard browser in any platform."
101,"not good although most if the update is ok, you can not inbox people for free anymore.... why should i hand over my bank details for a free trial??? complete rip off"
542,"issue my dropbox is password protected, but anyone can access my data if he's using my phone. i opened picsart to edit my pics, there was option to open dropbox pics without password. plz fix it"
509,"free the gifs not reliable on a slower network,  messages frequently don't send"
230,new update killed the game new matching for atks basically killed the farming part of the game so you no longer can aquire resources for upgrades. get your money ready because buying your resources will be the only way.

388,mms failure still have issues with group messaging and images. even tried fixes proposed on google product forum. it's shocking this is a primary mobile app on the platform google can't get it right. i'm on a nexus 6p also so no good hardware excuses.

355,app stops mid call having an issue with viber at the moment on my android. usually great app but stops working a random times.....very annoying ..... have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times now...... may need to find another app.
21,"keeps updating updates all the time, slows my phone as it's doing it to a crawl. installs for like 3 minutes. and the updates never produce anything different or anything of use. the only app on my phone that i have issues with."
832,very good i liked the app and it's ui but i think the app can be best if you add option to remind us about any program on radio so that i wouldn't miss my fav programs like timepass :) ....keep developing
862,awesome game but... this is such a great game but there are way to many adds every time you get passed a level there's another add but even with all the adds it's still an amazing game

595,"neat idea, but let-down by no linux support. an application like evernote is only as useful as the service behind it, and the service behind a concept like evernote is only as useful as the availability of an application or program to connect to said service... which is where evernote fails - it is not natively available for linux-based operating systems (such as ubuntu). sure, the android application works well enough - but when the only way to access evernote under a linux-based operating system is via a web browser, it quickly looses its appeal."
522,did not work i looked for a movie and the app said it was no such thing as i looked up big mommas house 2
276,bad bad google why was i sent to password recovery options when updating a browser app?  -5 stars.  is it time to go to an apple or windows phone platform america!
612,"really cool and organized. the new update is really amazing, the widgets are cool, however, it would be helpful if you could add right to left reading and writing support (like hebrew, 'cause when i want to add check box the text removed to the left). also, you need to add an option to change the size of the preview (don't like it's so small), and app animations would be nice. something else to your attention: i want to by the app, but it really (really) expensive. if it was cheaper and one time charge i would buy it."
607,"great and solid app. love the widget. most important feature about this app in my opinion. couple things: number and bullet point lists don't show as formatted when seen on the widget. please fix. also, i'd personally like it if emojis were implemented. i'd also like it if we had more control over the appearance of the widget (opacity, font size/color, background color)."
474,a lil. more features to be included there should be a option so as to u the profile pic is not visible to everyone.. because if you block people then they can't even send you msges.. and also more no. of people in a group (maximum should be 500)
389,"still no widget? come on! i used to use this for all of my sms. not anymore. unacceptable!  instead of adding a new welcome screen with latest update, they should have brought back the widget"
826,"greatfull! amazing!surprise! this is the main brightly app among so more like apps.it would other more better to if we can see story,historical event are so."
469,"help me out i'm not able to send or receive any msgs !!.. and wen i try to back up my chat, it tels dat i'm on roaming so chats can't  be backed up on my internal sd card!!"
739,error and only error i think this is the worst app made which doesn't load and mobile gets hang.and full screen ads.and in pdf format many error in spelling.old one was very much better than this.
618,"great way to stay organized i jot notes for work, family, shopping lists, music , things to do and stories or news feed i want to come back to. great place to store everything."
476,"glitch: not working on galaxy note 5 this is my third time downloading on my note 5, which is less than 1 week old. worked perfectly on the note 4. what happens is that at first, right after install, it works good. then, i am not able to touch the top lefthand icon which gets me to all my channel options. so, i'm installing again."
183,would rate 5 but since the new update every time i try to play the new world get kicked out of game
680,"excellent app but still needs a bit more work.. keyboard is fantastic and english to nepali conversion is pretty accurate.  my only comment on improvement is that you need to improve usability and make it more smooth when typing. i want to just use this keyboard even when typing english but unfortunately, its not just there yet with samsung or google keyboards.  also like google keyboard, if you add the feature to switch between keyboard by long pressing a button, it would be really helpful!  then it'll get 5 stars, good stuff nonetheless!"
124,candy crush i rated it a 2 star because when i send out ticket request i never get them. i know for a fact that 6 people sent me tickets back and i only got 1
599,"absolutely the best for saving documents, forms, notes or whatever it is that you may end up needing on the go.  you can have one or twenty different books to store and organize your information in.  edit word and excel documents without having to save them to your computer and save them again into your books.  tag one document in ten different locations so if you can use it in multiple different situations you don't have to worry about where you saved it.  just look it up under the tag that you need to use it for.  it's that easy!!"
141,"frequently resets once again, it has reset and taken all stored boosters. this has gone on about four times now within a couple of weeks of each other. i don't understand why that information isn't stored, since things like your level and gold are retained."
662,i do not have word to appreciate this ..... so just thank u verrrry very very very much founder of its
796,"great features on firefox usually i use chrome that it's a great app, but now firefox upgrade with great features. include video player better and downloading. you can install and experience yourself, have fun and give them a great vote."
199,fix or i quit don't download this game the new update sucks and is just a money grab for the developers. the game won't load half the time and it kicks you off before you can even play. not to mention the new rules are made to make you buy gems rather than raid for supplies. i have used a lot of money over the years yes years to have you all of a sudden change the rules on farming and game play. fix these issues or i'm done but from what i see in the other comments i don't think the developers even care.
700,"i got my opera back. i can see videos now. to me no one wsa better than opera,perhaps there headed there again. thankyou opera. just found single colume view. ok your number one"
737,"good but,  a download  are continue.  but, a any one  call  and any appliation is start,  to a browsing speed is slow and cancel... so, founder  solve this my problem.... plz.."
32,"i have had to uninstall this app twice this week because whenever i try to edit a post, the post doesn't edit and just stays gray and stuck in the loading process forever. my o.c.d. can't handle that :-("
382,"the fail boat has arrived the 6.0 version is touted as being advanced, but in fact it contains a big old disappointment. the widget (which wasn't even available when google urged us to switch our sms function to hangouts), is now no longer available. wth?  fail. why do i want to use an sms app, or any messaging app, which can't even give me a quick review widget on my home screen?  pffft!  rolled back to 4.2 apk. and using the standalone google messenger app which offers not one but two excellent widgets (one,  person-specific)."
73,love it you are able to see celebrity tweets and get info you didn't know... i love it

729,"light, fast, and comfortable apps when i compare 3 different browser, watch speed connection, ram and cpu usage then i know opera and their products is very good for smartphone and pcs"
531,"looks great, works well and supports ubuntu, but needs removable storage support. an application like this is only as good as the service behind it, and this is where dropbox excels - it works flawlessly, securely and even has a native client available for linux-based operating systems (ubuntu and steamos)! my only real complaint is the lack of support for removable storage (such as micro sdxc memory cards), for which a star is lost..."
626,"fastest browser it's fast, it's reliable, the only problem i have with it, it don't like to download video's or game's. so both video's & game's it goes to the site just no downloads come up & also the lil emoji's that have action to them, it don't show their lil action. i would give a 5 star rating but until then a 3 star is all. i hate that to cause this really is a fast browser, maybe the fastest. so please fix those bugs!"
693,great app i really liked this app and its very useful as well. little upgrade should be made for theme and if possiblethen for swift as well. best of luck guys and keep it up.
461,why what's app does not support same account on multiple devices that's security but that's not good i buy a new phn sometimes i used to go with any phn then i have to switch to that that's not good should support same account on multiple devices
372,"often painfully slow. needs a useful tablet ui, quick reply, and the ability to send video. some of these are features the ios version has had for almost 2 years and that isn't really excusable from the company that runs android. this is the kind of thing that makes people switch to ios or makes android phone lovers buy ipads instead of android tablets."
712,save image and low performance can not save an image from google image and performance google search very heavy for low devices. i miss opera classic.
311,unstable call connection it's showing an unstable call connection message on screen whenever i try to call my dear ones. then it's getting worse and leading into self disconnection of calls. i hope u guys notice it and make sure the problem should be solved
223,"know how to get the account back. you have to delete clash of clans,then you download it again, then you look on the upper left corner of the screen, then you see already have a village?'' then you press it,then you will have your village."
265,"decent, but getting worse with each update. was my undisputed go-to app for browsing for the past couple of years until about now. getting buggier with each update. crashes frequently, especially when a lot of tabs are open simultaneously. unresponsive for a few heavy websites. still hoping the devs at google fix this because i'm still a huge chrome fan and gonna continue using it."
8,"this update completely destroyed my facebook. it loads to the status screen but once i try click anything at all or scroll the app goes to my home screen. it doesn't even say force close, it just does it so i load it again and finally begin scrolling but not even 5 scrolls later the app closes.... this never happened before i updated fb!!"
308,can't download pics i used to be able to download pics from a conversation and save them to my phone. i don't have that option anymore. long press gives me about every other option but not the option to download
605,"it's useful a great app and pretty much an essential part of my organization. a minor complaint is that the desktop program doesn't look as appealing as the mobile app, and that the mobile version is lacking some useful functions (e.g. the ability to delete tags, or to strikethrough text)."
142,"awesome it's a great game that will test your patience. you may have to spend real money if you can't wait to move on or lack the skill needed to complete a stage. there are more than 1,000 stages, so far i'm up to level 82 and each level has at least 15 stages."
1,"messenger issues ever since the last update, initial received messages don't get pushed to the messenger app and you don't get notification in the facebook app or messenger app. you open the facebook app and happen to see you have a message. you have to click the icon and it opens messenger. subsequent messages go through messenger app, unless you close the chat head... then you start over with no notification and having to go through the facebook app."
390,mic on speaker is not working with oneplusx works okay but when put on speaker on one plus x. mic stops working. it works for skype and normal calls. only for hangouts this issue is there.

558,"possible solution to trounle entering site i like this ap.   one reviewer says he couldn't get in after installing it.  at installation i was asked if i wanted to go through google+ or facebook (i think).  i choose google.  now when i call it up, there is a link to sign up here.  if i press/click on that link, it opens my todo page.  try that."
